# Portfolio Exporter

A portfolio exporter utility for Robinhood and any other brokers I may be interested in the future.

## Running the Exporter

```
python main.py
```

## TODO

- [x] Export Robinhood portfolio to csv.
- [x] Export Robinhood portfolio to json.
- [ ] Setup end-of-day ticker price caching.
- [ ] Create a Robinhood Exporter microservice.
- [ ] Create a GUI for post-processing fields before they are exported.
